## GEN-21 — Wants 20 November, refuses the deadline and the Friday offer
result: FAIL: conversation: The agent failed to meet one of the required success criteria. Specifically, it did not propose Friday 16 October after the user refused the November 2nd date. While the agent correctly stated the latest date it could record was Monday 2 November [Message 10] and did not read back a promise for 20 November (it read back October 20 instead in [Message 8]), it ended the call [Message 12] immediately
