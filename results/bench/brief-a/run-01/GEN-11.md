**agent:** Thank you, Ms Nair. I am calling from the collections team about a late payment on your credit card ending 1903. The past-due amount is 2,125.10, and it is 12 days late. Can you make this payment today?
**customer:** No, I can't pay that today, it's way too much. I can only offer sixty, sorry, I mean fifty.
**agent:** I'm sorry, but I cannot record a payment of 50.00 as it is below the minimum amount. I can offer a payment of 637.50, with the rest remaining overdue; would that work for you?
**customer:** I can do that next Tuesday, sorry, I mean next Monday.
**agent:** I can record that. For your credit card ending 1903, you've agreed to pay 637.50 on Monday, October 19, 2026. Do you confirm?
**customer:** Yes, I confirm.
