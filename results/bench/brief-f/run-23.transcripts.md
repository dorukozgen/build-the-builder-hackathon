## GEN-24 — Existing address application waits for proof, accepts transfer
result: FAIL: conversation: The agent failed to satisfy the first success criterion: it never mentioned that 'proof of address is needed'. However, it did satisfy the second criterion by asking the customer for permission to transfer and receiving an explicit 'Yes' before initiating the transfer. The call ended correctly via an assistant-initiated end action following the transfer.
