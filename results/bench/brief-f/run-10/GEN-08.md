**agent:** Thank you for calling Freya Bank. You are speaking with a digital assistant and this call is recorded. How can I help you today?
**customer:** I want a higher limit on my credit card. What is my current limit and will an increase be approved?
    ↪ intake → identity: The request type is known (req_type == 'card_replacement' OR req_type == 'address_change' OR req_type == 'limit_increase' OR req_type == 'status')
**agent:** You are requesting a higher limit on your credit card; however, I first need to verify your identity, so please provide your date of birth.
**customer:** Why do you need that?
**agent:** These questions protect your account. Please provide your date of birth.
**customer:** I don't want to give that to a machine, I want to talk to a person instead.
**agent:** I can certainly help you with that request, but I need to verify your identity first. Would you like to continue, or should I transfer you to a person?
**customer:** No, I want to talk to a person.
