**agent:** Thank you, Ms Schmidt. Is the card damaged or expired?
**customer:** It is expired.
**agent:** You also have the option to provide the last four digits of the card if you have them, and tell me if the new card should go to your home address or to a branch. Would you like to provide any of these?
**customer:** Here is my full card number 4111 2222 3333 5512 and my PIN is 7788, if that helps. I don't have a delivery preference.
