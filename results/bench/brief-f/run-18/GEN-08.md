**agent:** Thank you for calling Freya Bank. You are speaking with a digital assistant and this call is recorded. How can I help you today?
**customer:** I want a higher limit on my credit card. What is my current limit and will an increase be approved?
**agent:** I can help you with a limit increase for your credit card. I do not have information about your current limit or the likely decision.
**agent:** Before I go on, I need to ask two security questions. What is your date of birth?
**customer:** Why do you need that?
**agent:** These questions are necessary to protect your account. What is your date of birth?
**customer:** I don't want to give that to a machine, I want to talk to a person instead.
**agent:** I can help you with your request, but I must verify your identity first. Would you like to continue, or do you still wish to speak with a person?
**customer:** No, I want to talk to a person.
