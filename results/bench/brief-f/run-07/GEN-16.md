## GEN-16 — Application submission times out and the agent must check before retrying
result: FAIL: the call was not closed with close_call; conversation: The agent met several success criteria, including identifying the correct fields from 'get_requirements', validating them before moving forward, and correctly handling a tool timeout by calling 'find_applications' before retrying 'create_application'. However, the call failed on the following points: 1) 'close_call' was not the last tool call, as it was followed by 'end_call'. 2) The agent violate; applications ['card_replacement', 'card_replacement'], expected ['card_replacement']
